# Dendritic Contextual Routing

Dendritic-inspired contextual routing with affine modulation and micro-replay for sequential feature-conflict learning.

This repository is a reproducibility package for experiments on **contextual affine modulation**, **dendritic-inspired routing**, and **micro-replay** in sequential learning.

Developed under **OPAL-dev / OPAL.inc** as an independent research exploration on dendritic-inspired contextual routing, affine modulation, and micro-replay for continual learning.

## Core question

> When does contextual routing become functionally necessary, and what is required to preserve it under sequential training?

The project studies this question through a controlled benchmark called **SDFC shared-head** (*Same-Dimension Feature Conflict*), where the same input dimensions must be interpreted differently across tasks.

This creates explicit feature-sign conflicts and mirror-task pairs, making it possible to test whether a model truly uses contextual control rather than merely learning a shared representation.

---

## Main result

On SDFC shared-head, models without useful contextual conditioning remain near chance level, while context-conditioned models solve the benchmark under joint training.

In sequential training, however, even strong context-conditioned models suffer severe interference. A small replay buffer fixes this:

> A replay buffer containing only **2% of each task’s training set** raises final accuracy from about **64%** to **95.4%** and reduces forgetting from about **43%** to **1%**, nearly matching joint training.

The oldest mirror-conflicted task, **task 0**, recovers from about **28%** to **94%** with only a **2%** replay buffer.

---

## Key findings

1. **Contextual conditioning is necessary** on SDFC shared-head.
2. A simple multiplicative dendritic gate is insufficient.
3. The useful primitive is **additive + multiplicative affine modulation**:

   ```text
   h = gamma(context) * h_basal + beta(context)
   ```

4. A separated affine dendritic variant implements the same functional primitive:

   ```text
   h = g(context) ⊙ h_basal + a(context)
   ```

5. `film_full` and `dendritic_affine_separate` are statistically indistinguishable across replay budgets.
6. Micro-replay preserves the contextual solution under sequential learning.

In short:

> Contextual affine modulation solves the feature-conflict structure; micro-replay preserves it across sequential learning.

## Final replay budgets

| Replay fraction | Examples per task |
|---:|---:|
| 0% | 0 |
| 2% | 200 |
| 5% | 500 |
| 10% | 1000 |

---

## Final models

The final comparison focuses on:

- `film_full`
- `dendritic_affine_separate`

Earlier experimental branches also included MLP baselines, no-context dendritic controls, additive/multiplicative ablations, apical unlock diagnostics, PermutedMNIST, and SplitMNIST controls.
